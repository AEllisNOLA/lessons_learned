# Things I've Learned at Bloc.io

## HTML
1. Honestly, I don't think there was much. I had a pretty strong grasp of HTML already.

## CSS
1. I had heard of Bootstrap, but didn't know it was a "CSS Framework". I also didn't know that there were other CSS Frameworks out there. I look forward to trying Google's Material UI, Foundation and Semantic UI and more.

## JavaScript
1. I have not yet began that section. Looking forward to it, though.

## Git
1. Using Git Markdown for all of the assignment submissions... and eventually on GitHub, as well.
    1. Oh, wow... just getting this. I assume .md stands for .markdown? 
2. Completed the Git-it tutorial, which helped me get used to GitHub. I'm still not 100% on it, but with practice I'm sure I'll get there.
